# TIC TAC TOE Game

# Project Overview:
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game "Tic-Tac-Toe," also known as "noughts and crosses." The game is designed to be played by two players, a human player and a computer opponent. It runs in a command-line environment, allowing users to play the game by entering their moves through text input.

# Features:

## Two-Player Gameplay:
The game supports two players - a human player and a computer opponent. The human player can compete against the computer in rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Interactive Console Interface:
The game provides an interactive console-based user interface, allowing players to input their moves using text commands.

## Player vs. Computer:
The computer opponent provides a challenging game experience by making intelligent moves based on the current game state. It simulates a simple AI strategy for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Turn-Based Gameplay:
Players take turns to make their moves. The game enforces turn-based gameplay, ensuring that each player makes one move at a time.

## Winning Condition:
The game checks for a winning condition after each move to determine if a player has won by forming a line of their symbols (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Executable Program:
The code can be compiled into an executable program, making it easy to run on various platforms without the need for a C compiler.

This project provides an interactive and enjoyable way to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer opponent in a console environment. It offers a challenging experience for players while demonstrating fundamental concepts of game logic and user interaction in C programming
